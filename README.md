# GRC Analyst Hands-On Projects Guide
Source: https://artempolynko.com/blog/7-grc-analyst-hands-on-projects/

## Overview
Breaking into GRC or compliance-focused cybersecurity roles can feel overwhelming, especially when most job listings demand real-world experience you don't yet have. That's where GRC analyst hands-on projects come in.
Just like how SOC analysts build skills through labs and real work simulations, aspiring GRC analysts can gain valuable, resume-worthy experience by completing practical projects that mirror actual tasks in risk, audit, compliance, and control mapping.

## Why Hands-On Projects Matter
Before diving into the projects, it's worth understanding why hands-on work is so powerful:

* Real-world application: GRC roles are not just theory — they require structuring compliance programs, managing risk registers, performing audits, and documenting policies. Hands-on work proves you understand frameworks in context.
* Bridging theory and practice: Many beginners know about compliance frameworks (like ISO 27001, NIST, SOC 2), but struggle to translate that knowledge into real controls, audit readiness, or vendor assessments. Projects help bridge that gap.
* Portfolio boost: A documented project — with steps, screenshots or evidence, outcomes — makes a stronger case than a resume bullet claiming familiarity. Hiring managers see proof of capability.
* Interview readiness: When you've actually built audit checklists, risk assessments, or compliance mappings, you can reference concrete examples during interviews — demonstrating both knowledge and applied experience.

How to Use This Guide
You do not need to build these labs by guessing. Let AI guide you step by step just like a personal mentor.
Recommended approach:

Copy any project description from this guide
Paste it into your preferred AI assistant
Request a full step-by-step walkthrough: environment setup, required tools, implementation steps, evidence collection, and how to document the final results for your resume or portfolio
Make sure to also ask about potential costs and how to minimize or avoid them


Project 1: Build a Mini Compliance Program (ISO 27001 / NIST)
Description
This project simulates the foundational work GRC analysts perform when setting up a compliance environment for a new or growing organization. You build a mini compliance program by selecting a framework (ISO 27001 or NIST 800-53), identifying assets, scoping the environment, documenting control requirements, and determining what gaps exist.
You create a small control matrix that lists each control, its requirement, current maturity, responsible owner, and needed remediation. This mirrors how organizations prepare for audits and certifications and introduces you to core compliance language and structure.
Reference: ISO 27001 standard
Quick Setup Steps

Choose a fictional company (for example, a SaaS startup or healthcare clinic) and define its scope: assets, systems, users, and data types.
Download the ISO 27001 Annex A control list or NIST 800-53 catalog to use as your baseline requirements.
Create a spreadsheet with columns such as:

Control ID
Requirement
Current Status
Owner
Needed Actions


Select at least 15–20 controls that apply to your environment and document whether they are implemented, partially implemented, or missing.
Write a brief one-page "Compliance Program Overview" describing your chosen scope, goals, and current level of maturity.
Highlight 3–5 gaps and propose realistic remediation steps that an organization could take to improve compliance readiness.
Store all evidence (matrix, notes, document drafts) as part of your growing portfolio.

Key Learning Outcomes

Understanding how compliance frameworks are structured
Learning how to map controls to business processes
Identifying gaps and building remediation plans
Documenting compliance maturity in a clear, structured format

Note: This project is essential because compliance programs form the backbone of every GRC function.

Portfolio Development Tips
When completing these projects:

Document thoroughly: Take screenshots, save configurations, and write clear explanations of your decisions
Create evidence files: Build a structured portfolio with before/after states, gap analyses, and remediation plans
Write summaries: For each project, create a 1-2 page summary explaining the business problem, your approach, and outcomes
Make it presentable: Use tools like GitHub, Notion, or personal websites to showcase your work
Practice explaining: Be ready to walk through your projects in interviews and explain your thought process

Next Steps
