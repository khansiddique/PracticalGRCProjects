## Potential Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: How did you approach the control assessment?**
A: I used a structured methodology evaluating 20 key ISO 27001 controls across organizational, people, physical, and technological domains. For each control, I assessed current implementation status using a 5-level maturity model, identified the control owner, documented gaps, and recommended specific remediation actions.

**Q: How did you prioritize the gaps?**
A: Gap prioritization was based on three factors: risk score (likelihood × impact), regulatory requirements, and operational impact. The two critical risks—weak authentication and delayed patching—scored 20 out of 25, representing immediate threats to customer data. These became Priority 1 gaps requiring action within 30-90 days.

**Q: What's your estimated timeline for certification?**
A: The roadmap spans 9 months across three phases. Phase 1 (months 1-3) addresses critical controls like MFA and patch management. Phase 2 (months 4-6) focuses on process maturity and documentation. Phase 3 (months 7-9) implements advanced controls and completes the certification audit. This timeline assumes adequate resources and executive commitment.

**Q: How did you calculate the budget?**
A: The $180K-$250K budget covers five categories: security tools ($85K-$110K including PAM, SIEM, DLP), external consulting ($45K-$60K), personnel costs ($30K-$50K), certification audits ($15K-$25K), and physical security ($5K-$10K). Estimates are based on typical enterprise tool pricing and consulting day rates.

**Q: What frameworks did you reference?**
A: The primary framework is ISO 27001:2022, specifically Annex A controls. The assessment also references the capability maturity model for control evaluation, NIST risk assessment methodology for likelihood/impact scoring, and CIS Controls for specific technical implementations like MFA and vulnerability management.
